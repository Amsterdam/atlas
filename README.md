# Data en informatie

The open-source codebase for the ["Data en Informatie" portal](https://data.amsterdam.nl/) of the City of Amsterdam; the central hub for objective, reliable and actual data, and information about Amsterdam. This portal contains three sections: redactional content including articles, animations, dashboards, and interactive data visualizations; an application part that visualizes data in an interactive map and tables; and a data catalog providing files and APIs for public and private use.

## Requirements

- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)

## Installation

Install all dependencies:

```
npm install
```

## Development

Start the application:

```
npm start
```

Then, open the application in your browser at [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/).

### Docker

The `docker-compose.yml` file contains environment variable declarations that are required for the application to run in production mode. The production environment can be set up locally by running
```
make start
```

The `Makefile` consists of other useful commands to stop, restart and rebuild the application. To see all commands, run
```
make help
```

## Testing

Jest unit test

```
npm test
```

### E2E testing

In order to E2E test the application make sure you have a development server running locally:

```bash
npm run start
```

After doing this open up a new terminal and run the following commands:

```
cd test/e2e
npm run start
```

This will start the E2E test, if you want to watch for changes you can also run `npm run watch` instead.

### Analyzing a production bundle

```bash
npm run analyze
```

### Deploying to a demo server

There are three demo servers that can be deployed to, to deploy to one of these servers run the following command on your branch.

```bash
npm run deploy:demo
```

## Other useful commands

- `npm run clean`
- `npm run lint`

## Known issues

- on windows there is a bug in sass-lint that prevents `npm run lint` to fail when there are linting errors.
  work-around: install sass-lint globally and run commands specified in the `lint:style` script direct in a bash
  terminal
